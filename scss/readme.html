    SCSS/SASS is a pre-processor to generate CSS.
    Here I added divided codes in four parts.
    First is _variables.scss to declare all variables at one place
    Second is _mixins.scss to declare all useful mixins
    Then included both of these files in _global.scss file where all common and global css code will be declared.
    At the end _global.scss file is included in style.scss file which is the main scss file.
    
    '_' is used in helper files name so that compiler will not create css files for them.
    
    To keep watch on scss file and convert it on save to css use following command on command prompt
    scss --watch sourceDirectory:targetDirectory
