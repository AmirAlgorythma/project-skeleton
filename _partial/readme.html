    As we are using php why not to take benefits of this popular technology.
    The best part is that with php we can easily include a file in some other file with following simple code
    
    <?php include 'path/filename.php' ?>
    
    its really simple and saves a lot time.
    Just for identification I have added it under _partial folder as these are the partial files not the main and also added .inc in the file name as these are includable files.
    
    using php to include files is better than using javascript as search engine bots can read php files and not the script files.
